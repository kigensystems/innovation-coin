### ⚠️ UNRESOLVED ISSUE:

**Arrow Positioning in Mission Section**
- Problem: Arrows between process cards are not properly centered vertically
- Multiple attempts to fix failed
- Current code has arrows with:
  - Container: `relative flex items-center`
  - Arrow: `absolute -right-5`
- Need to better understand the container structure and grid layout
- The arrows appear too low or misaligned
